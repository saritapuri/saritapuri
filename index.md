I'm currently working as a Post-doctoral researcher in Dr. Shang-Te Danny Hsu's lab at Institute of Biological Chemistry (IBC) Academia sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.
I did my PhD from IIT Delhi under supervision of Prof. Tapan K. Chaudhuri. I have experience in molecular cloning, SDM, bacterial protein expression, purification using various chromatographic technqiues, protein folding, misfolding, aggregation, post-translational modifications, enzymatic assays and chaperone-assisted protein folding.



## Published papers

2. **Inter and intra-subunit interactions at the subunit interface of chaperonin GroEL are essential for its stability and assembly**
3. **Improvement of structural stability and functional efficiency of chaperonin GroEL mediated by mixed salt**
